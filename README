SMSTrolley 0.1

  I am writing this app because I have faced enough problems and struggled all my to find a good piece of code that helps me create massively large SMS based application. This is the piece of code which I wish I had when I was building my SMS app. 

Goal of SMSTrolley:
-High Performance Server (Evented) that handles incoming and outgoing messages (Mind it I am not calling them MO and MT :-))
-Scalable , i.e Plugin based
-Intelligent Cost-model, used to take decision on which SMSC to choose on which event
-...many more
